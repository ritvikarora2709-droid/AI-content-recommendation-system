    "\n",
    "### b. Problem Statement\n",
    "With the rapid growth of content on streaming platforms, users often struggle to find movies that align with their interests, moods, or themes. Traditional recommendation systems rely heavily on user history, ratings, or keyword-based filtering, which fail in cold-start scenarios and lack semantic understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Objective\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build an AI-powered content recommendation system that:\n",
    "- Accepts free-text natural language queries\n",
    "- Understands semantic meaning instead of keyword matching\n",
    "- Recommends relevant movies from a global dataset\n",
    "- Supports both Hollywood and Bollywood content\n",
    "- Provides explainable recommendations with relevance scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. Real-World Relevance\n",
    "Such systems are widely used in OTT platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+, where intelligent content discovery significantly improves user engagement and retention.\n"
